Made around 2021 with horrendous code

My first attempt at making a video game made mostly alone aside from the visuals. A simple fast-paced 2D arcade action game made in Godot with the player only able to attack via dashes. The game consists of a tutorial introductory area and a single survival area. The game features two kinds of enemy with detection AI, cutscene, scoring system, and interactable environment.
